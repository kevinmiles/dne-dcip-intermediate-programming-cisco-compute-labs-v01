# Managing Cisco Compute with Ansible

Cisco UCS Python SDK provides Ansible modules for UCS Manager that enable Configuration Management of UCS Unified Fabric including network, server, and storage resources. This lab covers installation of the UCS Ansible modules and use of UCS Ansible modules to configure various UCS policies.

## Objectives

  - Upgrade Ansible version (if required)
  - Install UCS Ansible Modules.
  - Configure a UCS NTP Server.
  - Configure a UCS Timezone.
  - Configure a UCS VLAN.

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of UCS Compute, Python, and Ansible would be very helpful. However, this lab guide provides step-by-step procedures. Other than that, a desire to learn is all you need to bring with you.

## Product

Cisco UCS® Manager provides unified, embedded management of all software and hardware components of the Cisco Unified Computing System™ (Cisco UCS) and Cisco HyperFlex™ Systems across multiple chassis and rack servers and thousands of virtual machines. It supports all Cisco UCS product models, including Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers and C-Series Rack Servers, Cisco UCS Mini, and Cisco HyperFlex hyper-converged infrastructure, as well as the associated storage resources and networks.

 Ansible is an agent-less configuration management or orchestration tool. Users have the flexibility to turn their laptops into an Ansible control station to automate basic tasks, or users can deploy a dedicated host to use Ansible as an orchestration tool to rollout application updates while ensuring minimal downtime. Ansible provides a simple domain specific language (DSL) to enable these different use cases.

# Step 1

> ## *Before you begin this lab, please verify the Ansible version running on the Ubuntu instance in your dCloud pod. If reported version is 2.3 please follow below steps to upgrade Ansible to the version shown below.*
> ```
> (dci-py27-exercises) cisco@ubuntu:~/CiscoDevNet/code/dci$ ansible --version
> ansible 2.3.2
> (dci-py27-exercises) cisco@ubuntu:~/CiscoDevNet/code/dci$ pip install ansible==2.7.1
> Collecting ansible==2.7.1
> .
> .
> Successfully installed ansible-2.7.1
> (dci-py27-exercises) cisco@ubuntu:~/CiscoDevNet/code/dci$ ansible --version
> ansible 2.7.1
> ```

Install and utilize Cisco UCS Ansible modules in your lab environment on the Ubuntu host.

**Note:** The screen captures in this lab are from a Putty session launched from the Windows Desktop. Completing this lab from a **Terminal for Coding** session launched on the Ubuntu desktop will follow the same steps.

### Exercise 1

  1. Start a terminal session to the Ubuntu host:

    - Use Putty from Windows desktop
      - **ip address** — `198.18.134.28`
      - **login as:**  — `cisco`
      - **password** — `C1sco12345`

    - Choose Python **Virtual** Environment (`venv`) **2** for Python2.

  2. Install UCS Ansible Modules:

    - You will need the latest UCS Python SDK:

      - `sudo pip install ucsmsdk`
        - sudo password - `C1sco12345`

    - You will need the latest ucsm-ansible:

      - `git clone https://github.com/ciscoucs/ucsm-ansible`
      - `cd ucsm-ansible`

  3. Update the `inventory` file for the UCS Manager in your environment:

    - Using `vi` or `nano` update the inventory file to use these values
      - **ucs_ip** - `198.18.133.91`
      - **ucs_username** — `admin`
      - **ucs_password** — `C1sco12345`

      ![](assets/images/image-03.jpg)<br/><br/>

  4. Create the UCS Ansible `site.yml`:

  Several UCS Ansible modules are part of Ansible Core since the 2.5 release. Functionality to check for the presence of the UCS Python SDK and management of UCS connections are incorporated into the Ansible.

    - Using `vi` or `nano` create the `site.yml` file

  ```yaml
    ---

    - hosts: ucs
      connection: local
      gather_facts: no
  ```

  5. Test the the UCS Ansible module installation:

    - `ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml`

Next step: Create UCS configurations with UCS Ansible.
