# Mission: Self-Service Compute Scripts built with Python

Take what you've learned about UCS Python SDK from the Learning Labs and put that knowledge to use.

## Objectives

Completion time: 15

  - Use UCS Python SDK to Create UCS Python SDK Code

## Prerequisites

Knowing a bit about Python helps, and since you've most likely completed the Programming Cisco Compute Learning Labs for UCS Python SDK, you are all set and ready to go.

In the UCS Python SDK Labs you wrote code to perform actions in UCS Manager, using various methods to determine the UCS Manger Object Name or ClassID to figure out which Python module to use.

There are hundreds of UCS Python SDK modules, which might sound a bit daunting. How will you ever find the correct module for the desired operation? Fortunately there is a UCS Python SDK method that will help considerably in writing Python scripts that use UCS Python SDK.

`convert_to_ucs_python()` provides the ability to use a log file created from the UCS Manager GUI to generate the UCS Python SDK code to perform the same actions as those captured in the log.

### Exercise 1

Let's Give it a try.

1. Launch UCS Manager by ***double-clicking*** the UCS Manager icon on the Desktop.

  - **Username**: `admin`
  - **Password**: `C1sco12345`

  </br>UCS Manager Icon:

2. Capture UCS Manager XML operations

Due to the access method for the dCloud Pod environments this next step requires the use of the On-Screen Keyboard on the Windows Desktop.

  </br>Windows On-Screen Keyboard:

  ![](assets/images/image-02.jpg)<br/><br/>

  <!--![](assets/images/image-02.jpg)<br/><br/>

The UCS Manager GUI Window must be active, ***Clicking*** on the UCS Manager Windows will not cause the On-Screen Keyboard to be pushed to the back.

The UCS Manager GUI Window Title state will indicate if the window is active.

  </br>Active vs. Inactive UCS Manager GUI Window:

With the On-Screen Keyboard open in front of the UCS Manager GUI

  - ***Click*** the keys Ctrl + Alt + q

  </br>***Click*** the keys Ctrl + Alt + q:

    - ***Add*** another MAC Block
      - ***Click*** On the MAC Pool
      - ***Click*** On the "MAC Blocks" Tab
      - ***Click*** "Add"
      - ***Change*** "First MAC Address to" - "00:25:B5:00:00:80"
      - ***Enter*** "128" in the "Size" field
      - ***Click*** "OK"
      - ***Click*** "OK"

    <!--![](assets/images/image-10.jpg)<br/><br/>

    ![](assets/images/image-11.jpg)<br/><br/>

    <!--![](assets/images/image-11.jpg)<br/><br/>

    - ***Delete*** the MAC Pool
      - ***Right-Click*** on the MAC Pool
      - ***Click*** Delete
      - ***Click*** "Yes"
      - ***Click*** "OK"

    ![](assets/images/image-12.jpg)<br/><br/>

    <!--![](assets/images/image-12.jpg)<br/><br/>

    - ***Download*** the log file:
      - ***Click*** the "Stop XML Recording" link to stop logging
      - ***Enter*** - MAC_POOL_OPS_PY in the log file name pop-up
      - ***Click*** "OK", the file will download to `C:\users\demouser\Downloads\MAC_POOL_OPS_PY_xmlReq.log`

  converttopython.convert_to_ucs_python(xml=True, literal_path="C:\\Users\\demouser\\Downloads\\MAC_POOL_OPS_PY_xmlReq.log")
  ```

  ```Python
  from ucsmsdk.utils import converttopython

  converttopython.convert_to_ucs_python(xml=True,literal_path="C:\\Users\\demouser\\Downloads\\MAC_POOL_OPS_PY_xmlReq.log", dump_to_file=True, dump_file_path="C:\\Users\\demouser\\Desktop\MAC_POOL_OPS.py")
  ```

  </br>convert_to_ucs_python():

    handle = UcsHandle("198.18.133.91", "admin", "C1sco12345")

    handle.login()
    ```

  - Pause before MAC Pool deletion

    `raw_input("MAC Pool Created and Updated. Press Enter to Delete Mac Pool...")`

  - Logout from UCS Manager

    `handle.logout()`

  </br>Edit MAC_POOL_OPS.py:
