# Mission: Managing Cisco Compute with Ansible

Take what you've learned about Ansible from the Managing Cisco Compute with Ansible Learning Lab and put that knowledge to use in this mission that takes you deeper into UCS Ansible Modules.

## Objectives

Completion time: 10 minutes

  - View `cisco_ucs_dns.py` in the ucsm-ansible library to understand how to use the module to add a DNS Server to UCS
  - Create `site.yml` to add a DNS Server to UCS Manager
  - Update `site.yml` to delete the DNS Server from UCS Manager

## Prerequisites

Knowing a bit about Ansible, Python and UCS Manager helps and since you've most likely completed the several of those Learning Labs prior to this mission, you are all set and ready to go.

### Exercise 1

Add a DNS Server to UCS Manager

1. The UCS Ansible modules are located in the `library` directory in the `ucsm-ansible` directory. Change to the `library` directory and view the UCS Ansible module for managing DNS servers

2. View the usage example

3. Update `group_vars/all` with a DNS server variable

4. Create/Update `site.yml` with the appropriate ansible notation to add a DNS server to UCS Manager

5. Apply the `site.yml` ansible playbook
